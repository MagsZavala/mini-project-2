                        <p>Welcome to my coding portfolio! My name is Magali Zavala, and I'm thrilled to embark on a new journey into the world of coding. At 27 years young, I'm diving headfirst into a Boot Camp Full Stack Flex Coding Program at the prestigious University of California, Berkeley. This program marks a pivotal moment in my career, and I couldn't be more excited about the opportunities it presents.</p>

                        <p>While my background primarily consists of customer service roles in restaurants, retail, and office environments (including volunteering at my local church, St. Joseph), I've always been drawn to the dynamic field of technology. Currently, I'm gaining proficiency in HTML/CSS, Git, and JavaScript, laying the foundation for my future projects and endeavors.</p> 
                                
                        <p>Below, you'll find a showcase of my work thus far, representing my passion for web development and my dedication to honing my skills in this ever-evolving field. As I continue to grow and learn, I'm eager to expand my expertise beyond web development, exploring areas such as analytics and cybersecurity.</p>
                                
                        <p>What excites me most about coding is its boundless possibilities and the opportunity to make a tangible impact. My goal is to contribute to the vision of innovative startups, leveraging my newfound skills to bring their ideas to life. I'm committed to lifelong learning and look forward to adding more projects to my portfolio as I progress on this exciting journey.</p>
                                
                        <p>Thank you for visiting my portfolio, and I invite you to explore my work and connect with me as I continue to pursue my passion for coding!</p>
